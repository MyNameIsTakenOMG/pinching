# Pinching

Pinching is an e-commerce web app sample, built with **micro-service architecture**.  For communication between independent services, I am using *rabbitmq* as my message broker to deal with asynchronous calls, and using REST and gRPC calls to handle synchronous communication.

## Motivation
The goal to build this project is to do re-invent the wheel - creating an e-commerce web app out of real-life examples, such as Amazon, trying to duplicate some great features, such as order-tracking. Also at the same time, to practice the concepts and techniques I learned about micro-service in the past along the way.
